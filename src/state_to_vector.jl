# Set of functions to convert states of various types into vectors
function state_to_vector(state)
    """ state_to_vector

        Build a state vector by recursively moving through the elements of a more
        complex state (matrix, cell array, or struct), saving the numerical 
        values along the way in a vector. This is used in odehybrid to convert a
        complex series of states into a vector to be used for continuous state
        updates. The reverse function is vector_to_state.

        vector = state_to_vector(state);
        
        Inputs:
        
            state:   A numeric, cell array, or struct array type, the contents of
                        which consist of numeric, cell array, or struct array types, etc.
        
        Outputs:

            vector:  A vector containing the numerical values from the state (doubles)

        Example:
        
            
            x = [ [1 3; 4 2], TestStruct(a = [5; 6], bcd = [7:9; 10],  Ï€ ]
            v = state_to_vector(x)
            x2 = vector_to_state(v, x)
            x == x2
