function vector_to_state(vector, state, count)
    """ vector_to_state

        Build a state from a state vector by recursively moving through the 
        elements of a more complex example state (matrix, cell array, or struct),
        placing the relevant numerical values from the vector into the 
        appropriate places. This is used in odehybrid to convert a state vector
        into the original complex setup of states. The reverse function is
        state_to_vector.

        state = vector_to_state(vector, state);
        
        Inputs:
        
            vector  A vector containing the numerical values from the object
            state   A numeric, cell array, or struct array type representing the
                    sizes and types for the values in vector
            count   (Internal use only)
        
        Outputs:

            state   A numeric, cell array, or struct array type
            count   (Internal use only)

        Example:

            x = [ [1 3; 4 2], TEST_STRUCT(a = [5; 6], bcd = [7:9; 10]), Ï€]
            v = state_to_vector(x)
            x2 = vector_to_state(v, x)
            x == x2
